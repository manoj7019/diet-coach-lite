        <h1>Points to remember :</h1>
        <p>TDEE - Total Daily Energy Expenditure</p>
        <p>BMR - Basal metabolic rate (For most of us - BMR = 50-70% TDEE)</p>
        <p>🥱🔥 NEAT - Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (10-30% of TDEE)</p>
        <p>🏋🏻‍♂️🔥 EAT - Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (0-30% of TDEE)</p>
        <p>🍛🔥 TEF - Thermic effect of food (5-10% of TDEE)</p>
        <br>
        <p>🍗🥦🔥 Protein and Fiber thermogenesis ~ 30%</p>
        <p>🍞🧈🔥 Carbs (~5-10%) and Fats thermogenesis (~0-3%)</p>
        <br>
        <p>❗ If haven't lost atleast 50% of goal weight loss target, reduce Carbs & Fats intake by 10%, still no expected result? Reduce another 10%. </p><br>
        <h2>Weight Gain</h2>
        <p>Overfeeding😋 + No resistance training🥱 = 30-50% 🔺 Lean Mass</p>
        <p>Overfeeding😋 + Resistance training🏋🏻‍♂️ = 100% 🔺 Lean Mass</p>
        <p>✅ New lifter will add Lean Mass at much faster rate than people with 5+ years of consistent resistance training.</p>
        <p>✅ We should allow 30% increase in our relative body fat percentage during gaining phase i.e. If we started at 10% Body Fat Percentage, we should go upto 13%.</p>
        <p>❗ If we failed to gain weight, increase Carbs and Fats intake by 5-10%.</p><br>
        <h2>Body Fat Percentage</h2>
        <p>❗DXA scans, which use low energy X-rays to determine body fat (this is preferred)</p>
        <p>❗Skin calipers, which measure the folds of the skin (most accessible)</p>
        <p>✅ Have to look for the way to calculate Body Fat Percentage.</p>
